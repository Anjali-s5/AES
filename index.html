    <h2>What is AES?</h2>
    <p>
      The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric encryption algorithm 
    that has become the global benchmark for securing digital information. 
    Introduced in 2001 by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 
    AES replaced the older Data Encryption Standard (DES), which had become 
    vulnerable to modern computing power. 
    AES works by transforming plain, human-readable data into ciphertext, 
    which appears completely scrambled and unreadable without the correct 
    secret key. Unlike asymmetric systems (where two different keys are used), 
    AES is <em>symmetric</em>, meaning the same key is required for both 
    encryption and decryption. This makes AES very fast, efficient, and suitable 
    for a wide variety of applications.

    <h2>Where is AES used?</h2>
    <p>
      AES plays a critical role in everyday technologies â€” securing online 
      banking, Wi-Fi connections, encrypted messaging apps, file storage, and 
      even government communications. Its strength and efficiency make it 
      suitable for both software and hardware implementations.
    </p>
<p>
    Some of the most common areas where AES is used include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Internet Security:</strong> AES is built into HTTPS connections, ensuring secure communication between your browser and web servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Wi-Fi Protection:</strong> Protocols like WPA2 and WPA3 use AES to secure wireless networks against unauthorized access.</li>
    <li><strong>Messaging Apps:</strong> Popular apps like WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram use AES as part of their encryption systems to keep chats private.</li>
    <li><strong>Banking & Finance:</strong> Online banking platforms use AES to secure sensitive transactions and account details.</li>
    <li><strong>File Encryption:</strong> AES is the default algorithm in tools like WinRAR, 7-Zip, and BitLocker for protecting files and drives.</li>
    <li><strong>Government & Military:</strong> AES-256 is approved for securing top-secret government information.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>About this Project</h2>
    <p>
      This project demonstrates AES encryption and decryption in a simple, 
      interactive way. Enter a message and a secret key to see how your data 
      is transformed into unreadable ciphertext and then decrypted back to 
      the original form.
	 By experimenting with this tool, you can get a hands-on understanding of 
     how encryption works in real systems. This project is designed for learning 
     purposes, and while it demonstrates the basics, AES in practice is implemented 
     in more advanced and secure ways in real-world applications.
